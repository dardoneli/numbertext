# Number Text
## Description from https://www.numbertext.org/
The NUMBERTEXT/MONEYTEXT functions originally developed for the generalization of the BAHTTEXT spreadsheet function, a function of Microsoft Excel for number to Thai number name and currency conversion, standardized by the ECMAâ€“376 and ISO/IEC 29 500:2008 Office Open XML format. This development can help the upcoming OpenFormula to be top-compliant with the ECMA/ISO BAHTTEXT without degrading its high requirements for an international standard.

## Acknowledgments
